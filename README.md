# Reflections

(Required)
üéØ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
‚Ä¢ Thumbnails load quickly
‚Ä¢ Larger image displays on selection of thumbnail
‚Ä¢ Accessible conciderations including alternative text for images, and the ability to cycle through images with the arrow keys
‚Ä¢ One page, with a set of thumbnail images, and a larger image
‚Ä¢ Styled appropriately with CSS, and make use of media queries.
‚Ä¢ Use client-side JavaScript to display the larger image when a thumbnail is selected

üéØ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
‚Ä¢ Use client-side JavaScript to navigate between images using the keyboard (tab, enter). This is because it was battling the arrow keys, I wanst sure how to resolve this in time.
‚Ä¢ Voiceover = Not enough time to attempt
‚Ä¢ I managed to acheive a focus ring around objects to highlight what is selected, only problem is this conflicted with the arrow keys as stated above. code is left marked out for review.

üéØ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
‚Ä¢ The understanding of how things are conflicting.

(Optional)
üèπ Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.
‚Ä¢ I have to give thanks to Manny, Joe, Alex, Theo and Richard for taking the time to explain things, collaborate, and share insights.
